# Installation using Vagrant

The best way to learn Kubernetes is to start using it. Lets setup Kubernetes cluster in our PC real quick  using vagrant & Virtualbox.
The idea here is not to learn/understand the installation process but to get some overview & hands-on experience of the components in Kubernetes cluster.

**Pre-req:**
-Install VirtualBox
-Install Vagrant
-Gitbash(if you are using Windows)
- 8GB RAM
