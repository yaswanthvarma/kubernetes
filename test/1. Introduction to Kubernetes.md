# Introduction to Kubernetes

**What is Kubernetes?**
Kubernetes is an open-source software for deploying and managing containers across multiple nodes.
We can deploy & manage containers using a container runtime like Docker on a single host, however if you want to run containerized applications on multiple nodes to implement high availability, scalability & fault tolerance, container runtimes cannot provide an effective solution. This is where we need a “container orchestration software” like Kubernetes.

Kubernetes supervises & takes care of networking, service discovery and health of all components that are part of the cluster.

Another reason for Kubernetes being so popular is that it allows us to integrate with many third party softwares to implement networking, security, storage, monitoring etc.
